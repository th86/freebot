# Freebot - Zero-cost LLM Chatbot Service Framework

This is a minimalist example of LLM-based chatbot using OpenRouter API and is hosted on Vercel. 

Here is a [working demo](https://freebot-wine.vercel.app/).

Before you start, you need: 
* a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) hobby account 
* an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) token

To launch your own chatbot:
1. Create a new project on Vercel by importing this repository.
2. Add your OpenRouter token in `Environment Variables` of the project as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
3. Deploy the project.
